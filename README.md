# eggobase

## What is this?

- An egg based 'web application'
- It serves as a medium to learn about Servlets, JSPs and JSTL
    - And Java 8+ serverside development in general
- It also serves as a reference of how to build simple stuff using Java + PostgreSQL

## Vague future plan

- JUnit
- TravisCI
- Dockerise
    - Tomcat
    - All required libs
    - environment vars
    - PostgreSQL
- ...to make a CI/CD pipeline
- Deploy to GCP in an automated manner

## Fun things to do in the future

- Upload pictures of eggs
- Use some off-the-shelf GCP ML thing to detect whether or not the picture is actually an egg
